    <strong>JVM</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java and Groovy API’s and frameworks.<br/>
        I have recently worked with Spring MVC 5, Spring Security 5, JPA/Hibernate.<br/>
        In my current role Groovy is the primary language used - and I am familiar with many of the language's features. <br/><br/>
    <strong>Web Development</strong>: My server side web development experience has largely been based on RESTful Java via Jersey.<br/>
        I have also worked with client side technologies such as: Javascript, Angular (both .js and .io), Extjs, jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS and have also experimented with other interesting technologies such as Backbone and Underscore.<br/><br/>
    <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with Subversion, Git, Maven, Gradle, and Jenkins.<br/>
        I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
    I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time.<br/><br/>
    I occasionally write a blog covering life, technical subjects, and opinion articles at: <a target='_blank' href="http://trash80.org/blog/">Nerd @ Play</a><br/><br/>
